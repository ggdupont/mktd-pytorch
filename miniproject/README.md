#Â Ideas for project :

- fashion mnist
- NLP
- some simple reinforcement learning



## Objectif :

1. Train a Model on fashion MNIST.
2. Create a function to transform any image into a format compatible with the model.
3. Package the Model into a web service to make predictions on image sent by url.
4. Search the web for images using keywords as 'shirts', 'pants' or 'dress'.
5. Use your web service against such images and check for mistakes.
6. Try to improve your Model using newly acquired images to retrain it.
7. Get the best score over the final validation dataset !


## Notes:

All the work above should be done in team.
You can use multiple Models and combine their results to improve your score.
Anything is allowed !
Good luck ...
